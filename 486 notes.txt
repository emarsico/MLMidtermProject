slack variables correspondents with dual vars. y1 y2 etc:

pos y1 vaues mean basic slack



Similarly, the xs and the vs have the same relation.


every variable has a role of a control variable and a slack variable.

y2>0. slack variable is y2


if x1 is a slack variable, than v1 must be its control variable.


x1 > 0, make less tan so (-1,0) is the proper form.


increase b1 in the direction of the gradient.


If we have a point wiuth 3 active contsraints, there are 3 ways to pair the constraints
